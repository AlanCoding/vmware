minor_changes:
  - vmware_guest_tools_info - Use `toolsVersionStatus2` instead of `toolsVersionStatus` (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/2033).
deprecated_features:
  - vmware_guest_tools_info - `vm_tools_install_status` will be removed from next major version (5.0.0) of the collection
    since the API call that provides this information has been deprecated by VMware.
    Use `vm_tools_running_status` / `vm_tools_version_status` instead (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.vmware/issues/2033).
